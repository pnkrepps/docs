## Configuring notifications

The project owners/editors and organization owners/admins can configure the notifications for the events visible to them. They can choose if they want to receive notifications in the in-app inbox, by email, or both. They can also configure email notifications for their teams in their organization. 

Project-level notifications are configured in the project.

Notification settings made by a user apply only to that user. If an email notification is enabled, the email is sent to the email address associated with the user's login.

## Viewing notifications

Users in the following roles can view the notifications:
- Organization owners can view the organization notifications. 
- Project owners/editors can view the project notifications.
- User can view their own account notifications. 

Each notification indicates the level and project it belongs to for the user having multiple roles in BigAnimal.

To view the email notifications, check the inbox of your configured email addresses.
